1. Json_parser.py will convert the json to tabular format.
2. The data has loaded to MySQL database.
3. Json Data is transformed into 1st normal form. It is good to maintain the data in 3rd normal form. To write the queries for this use case 1st normal form is suffice. So data is loaded to sql db in 1st normal form.
4. sql_solution.sql has code for the queries.

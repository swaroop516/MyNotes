How many hidden layers we can give in neural network and what is the consequence if we give more hidden layers?

How do we know we applying stochastic or batch gradient

What is batch_size in ANN and epoc?
As per myunderstanding batchsize is after number of rows weights has to be updated.


classifier.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = 10, nb_epoch = 100)
Here nb_epoch means 100 times weights will get updated in iteration way.
And batch_size = 10 means for every 10 observations weights will get updated.
If i correlate these 2. Does this mean for intiail 10*100=1000 observations weights will get updated? Based on this it will predic for rest?Correct me if am wrong on this
Can we correlate these 2 or not? If yes how we can correlate?

Weights will get varied even in testing set also?
For each image weight will get differ? Or it will generalise based on all training sets?

Need to study:
objects detection in image using python
P Value
CNN flow
Time series problems
CNN vs RNN vs LSTM
Cookies?What kind of information we get in that?
GUI using python
object detection in video using python
Text Analysis
Neural networks usage in nlp
Table operators in teradata
REST API and SOAP API
Reason for SVM is slow for very large dataset than Logistic regression?

#ZIP-
zip will always return tuple

Python code-
b='abcdefghi'
for i in zip(*[iter(b)]*2):
    print(i)

Result-
('a', 'b')
('c', 'd')
('e', 'f')
('g', 'h')

#setdefault-
The setdefault() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.

If the key does not exist, insert the key, with the specified value

Python code-
car = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}

x = car.setdefault("color", "white")

print(x)

Result-
Mustang

#Append and Extend-
Append adds its argument as a single element to the end of a list. The length of the list itself will increase by one.
Extend iterates over its argument adding each element to the list, extending the list. The length of the list will increase by however many elements were in the iterable argument.

eg-
x = [1, 2, 3]
x.append([4, 5])
print(x)
[1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]

x = [1, 2, 3]
x.extend([4, 5])
print (x)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


#Frequency in List
a = [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,5,5]
d = {x:a.count(x) for x in a}

#to print elements side by side
print(i,ends="")


#to get all modules and versions
pip freeze
